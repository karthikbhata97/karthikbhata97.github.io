I've setup my new blog with hope to write about security regulary. I spend time doing CTFs on various platforms. I get to know most of the updates on security through twitter.

I like binary exploitations. [Exploit-exercise](http://exploit-exercises.com/) has really good VMs for learning.

[CTFtime](http://ctftime.org/) is a great place to get updates on upcoming CTFs.

[Cryptopals](http://cryptopals.com/) is the best place to start learning real-world cryptography.

Tools I use:
```
Editor: Visual Studio Code, vim
Session: tmux
Virtual Machine: Kali-linux on VirtualBox
Programming language: Python and C 
```

My CTF handle is ```an0ne```
